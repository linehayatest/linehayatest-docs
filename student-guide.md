### FAQ

**What if I get disconnected while chatting?**

If you suddenly get disconnected, you will still be connected to the same volunteer until the volunteer ends the conversation.

**What if the volunteer disconnects while chatting?**

If the volunteer disconnects, you can end the conversation, in which case the volunteer will be informed; or you can wait until the volunteer has reconnected to keep chatting with them.

**How is chat data stored?**

Chat data is stored in browser storage (in a similar way to cookies), which may be local storage, session storage or IndexedDB, depending on the technologies that your browser supports. The chat data is cleared once the conversation ends.

**What happens to chat messages sent while either I or the volunteer were disconnected?**

You will receive the messages when you reconnect, if the conversation hasn't ended.

### FAQ

The call will end, there is no reconnect functionality for voice calls.
